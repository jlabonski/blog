I've come to realize that there's a bunch of stories, ideas, accomplishments,
and insights that I really haven't shared. I'm not on any social media, so
when I do something interesting or achieve a hard-won victory over inanimate
objects, it just sits in my head. There's no quick app to digest it into small
bites to fling into a ad-strewn timeline.

I rationalize the lack of sharing of these moments as either easily
self-evident or uninteresting: who in the world would really want to read
about rewiring a treadmill with an arduino, Generac valve lash, stupid
Kubernetes tricks, NodeJS event loops, or pulling ethernet cable through an
insulated wall? In reality, _someone somewhere_ might find it terribly useful.
The same way I scour Google looking for videos and forum posts for esoteric
topics in software and home ownership.

I'm doing both myself and potentially others a disservice. My looking back on
hard-won work as self-deprecatingly obvious isn't too healthy. Plus, this
gives me the opportunity to write a little. I haven't had an actual blog since
1999 or so, when I was handwriting HTML in vi on Temple's servers! It's been a
long while since I've shared something to a wide audience in a deliberate
fashion that wasn't corporate in nature. It should be fun.

Since I'm moderately disgusted with the Big Money Aggregators of "Web 2.0" and
laughing too hard at "Web 3.0" and the blockchain, I'm going back to my roots
with just a simple webpage: no distributed CDN, no analytics packages tied to
Facebook or Google, no ads, no monetization, no external libraries at all. Web
1.0 at its finest. Posts on a webserver. If anyone reads it I'll be a bit
amazed. And since there's no analytics I won't even know unless I get
contacted.

Let's see what happens.
