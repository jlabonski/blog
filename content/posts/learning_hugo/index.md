## Introduction

I'm having a lot of fun and/or pain so far with wrangling
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which builds this site. I last built hand-tuned
HTML back in the early 2000's, and professionally I've been more of a backend
engineer and architect and kept the oddities of CSS and HTML 3/4/5 at a
comfortable arm's length. Setting out to blog on a webserver means that I'm
going to have to shorten that arm's length considerably.

My one requirement for this was it's gotta be fast. Lightning fast. I miss ye
olden days of when websites actually loaded and rendered quickly. More and
more I've been annoyed with websites taking an inordinate amount of time to
load and render, blocking content as ads or the last font loads in from some
weirdly misbehaving CDN. No tricks, nothing weird, no server-side generation
of anything.

I had bumped into Hugo a while ago and bookmarked it, and finally dusted it
off. CLI based, backed by Markdown, handles all of the ooey-gooey fluff for
me? Sign me up! I have no desire to try and become a HTML, CSS and SASS expert
overnight. I was sure that there'd be enough swearing working with the Hugo
based Go generators and a theme. And I was right!

It's absolutely rewarding at times to step clearly outside of your comfort
zone and get involved with some technology you're deeply unfamiliar with.
Frustrating would be the first word I'd use, followed by begrudging acceptance
and some eventual hard-won victories. You're looking at the results. Plus,
check out that speed:

## Site Internals

### Theme and modules

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 0.92.2 extended.

Right now I'm running the [Clarity
theme](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity), with some modifications.
There's been a rather large change in how Hugo handles themes and various
plugins and modules. Old style workflows had you running `git submodule add`
to pull in source code, which is the worst way to do work. Frankly, when you
see that in documentation you should consider running, or at least being
deeply skeptical of the authors.

The new way of working in Hugo to declare a module, and it's much cleaner.
Modules act as self-contained components, and the... temptation... of editing
files directly and damning yourself to git hell is gone. The only gotcha was
that the actual site itself needed to be a module. Some of the
[documentation](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/#use-a-module-for-a-theme
) isn't exactly clear on this, and you don't need anything special or
github-based to enable modules. 

```console
    $ hugo mod init labonski-dummy
```

From there, all you need for a theme install is to pull it in via a mod

```toml
[module]
    [[module.imports]]
        path = "github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity"
```

Updating is easy enough with `hugo mod get -u`.

### Customizing

Modules make pulling in themes easy, they make modification harder. You have
to craft a series of overrides, and hope that the theme author did their
homework and made it easy to poke and prod. Without much to compare against
(given by depth with Hugo), I'm happy so far with Clarity.

My Adobe photography license gives me access to their whole font catalog,
which is surprising. The main body font is [Minion
3](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/minion-3), which is one of my favorites. I
yoinked the `{woff2,woff,otf}` files from their generated CSS and transferred
them to the theme's recommended landing spot, `_custom.sass`.

```scss
@font-face 
    font-family: 'Minion'
    font-style: normal
    font-weight: 400
    src: url('#{$font-path}/minion3/regular.woff2') format('woff2'), url('#{$font-path}/minion3/regular.woff') format('woff'), url('#{$font-path}/minion3/regular.otf') format('opentype')
    font-display: swap

@font-face 
    font-family: 'Minion'
    font-style: italic
    font-weight: 400
    src: url('#{$font-path}/minion3/italic.woff2') format('woff2'), url('#{$font-path}/minion3/italic.woff') format('woff'), url('#{$font-path}/minion3/italic.otf') format('opentype')
    font-display: swap

// and so on...
```

and then `_override.sass`

```scss
html
    --font: "Minion", Merriweather, Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif
    font-feature-settings: "onum" on, "liga" on, "zero" on
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: "subpixel-antialiasing"
```

With Merriweather above being the font Clarity came with. Pro tip: **lint your
sass**. I spent a considerable amount of time (mainly due to being an absolute
neophyte with sass and css) tracking down why only the last font in the block
loaded. It turned out that a copy-n-pasted <kbd>TAB</kbd> inside of the
indentation causes sass to interpret blocks differently. Hugo provided no
warnings about inconsistent tabs, and VS Code was quiet. A fun few hours! This
is what it looks like:

![Busted SASS indentation in Firefox's Style Editor](bad_sass.png "Bad SASS
parsing")

If you're loading fonts and only the last one takes (or none at all), check
your indentation!

For an accent I tossed in [Forma DJR Micro
Light](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/forma-djr-micro) for post headings and
navigation to switch things up a little. While this sounds like I know what I
was doing, I merely followed a bunch of recommended fonts from Adobe. I tried
a few and settled on the light, airy lines of Forma, which is a nice contrast
to the seriousness of Minion. `_override.sass` continues:

```scss
$title_font: "Forma DJR Micro";

.post_title
    font-family: $title_font
    font-style: normal

.post_link
    font-family: $title_font
    font-style: normal

.author_header
    font-family: $title_font
    font-style: normal

.mt-4
    font-family: $title_font
    font-style: normal

.nav_item
    font-family: $title_font
    font-style: normal
```

## TODO

* Figure out why `-moz-osx-font-smoothing` isn't getting set right. It makes
  the fonts a bit unnaturally thin and hard to read on MacOS
* Finish the About page
* Why aren't line numbers in code blocks working?
* Finalize the post archetype metadata
* Set up content categories and tags
* Tweak colors. Red inline `code text`? Wow.
* Set up some linters
* Set up CI: end goal is commit to post

And, uh...

* Write content

## Conclusion

I spent a lot of time wrestling with SASS and CSS and fonts, mainly because I
love good typography but also because I have no idea how most of it works, and
it gives immediate feedback. It says a bit about me that I'll spend days
hammering out the sass override pipeline instead of writing content.
